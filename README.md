# Cyberhex

## Development
Cyberhex is currently in heavy development.

## Overview
Cyberhex is a business-oriented antivirus solution developed as part of my MA project for KSW. The project aims to provide robust cybersecurity measures with a focus on central management and control.

## Features
- **Centralized Management**: A central server facilitates the management and monitoring of multiple client systems.
- **Client Daemon**: Each client system runs a daemon responsible for executing scans and other security-related tasks.
- **Database Management**: The server manages databases containing critical information such as virus signatures, logs, and client configurations.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale efficiently to handle varying numbers of clients and growing databases.
  
## Getting Started
To get started with Cyberhex, follow these steps (there will be an instruction sheet later on):
1. **Clone Repository**: Clone the Cyberhex repository to your local machine.
2. **Server Setup**: Set up the central server.
3. **Client Installation**: Install the client daemon on each client system.
4. **Configuration**: Customize the configuration files according to your requirements.
5. **Run**: Start the server and client daemons to begin managing and protecting your network.
